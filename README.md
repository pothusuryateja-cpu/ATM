 ATM System — Python OOPS Project

This project is a simple ATM simulation program built using Object-Oriented Programming (OOPS) in Python. It models real-world banking operations like balance checking, cash withdrawal, and deposit using classes, objects, and methods.
 Features
User login with PIN authentication
Balance inquiry
Cash deposit
Cash withdrawal with validation
Transaction handling using class methods
Secure account data using encapsulation
OOPS Concepts Used
Class & Object — Models real ATM and account behavior
Encapsulation — Protects account details like PIN and balance
Inheritance (optional, if extended)
Abstraction / Polymorphism (if used in your design)
 How to Run
Install Python (3.x recommended)
Download or clone this repository
Open the project file in an editor or terminal
